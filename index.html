								<p> 
									Rhythm and blues, often abbreviated as R&B or R'n'B, 
								   is a genre of popular music that originated in 
								   African-American communities in the 1940s. 
								   The term was originally used by record companies to 
								   describe recordings marketed predominantly to urban African Americans, 
								   at a time when "urbane, rocking, jazz based music with a heavy, 
								   insistent beat" was becoming more popular.
								   In the commercial rhythm and blues music typical 
									of the 1950s through the 1970s, the bands usually 
									consisted of piano, one or two guitars, bass, drums, 
									one or more saxophones, and sometimes background vocalists.
									R&B lyrical themes often encapsulate the African-American 
									experience of pain and the quest for freedom and joy, 
									as well as triumphs and failures in terms of 
									relationships, economics, and aspirations.</p>

									The term "rhythm and blues" has undergone a number of 
									shifts in meaning. In the early 1950s, it was frequently 
									applied to blues records. Starting in the mid-1950s, 
									after this style of music contributed to the development of rock and roll, 
									the term "R&B" became used to refer to music styles that developed from 
									and incorporated electric blues, as well as gospel and soul music. 
									From 1960s to 1970s, several British R&B musicians such as Jimmy James 
									and the Vagabonds, Geno Washington, Carl Douglas, and Hot Chocolate 
									gained hits. Rock bands such as the Rolling Stones, the Who and the 
									Animals were referred to and promoted as being R&B bands; 
									posters for the Who's residency at the Marquee Club 
									in 1964 contained the slogan, "Maximum R&B". </p>

								<h2>
									2 Characteristics of Classic R&B:
								</h2>
								<p>
									Classic R&B of the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s is united by several key elements.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="flip-card-back">
								<p>1. Strong overlap with rock music: 
									Many of the best R&B acts of this early era were co-categorized 
									as rock ‘n' roll. These predominantly Black artists in turn 
									inspired many white rock bands, including the Beatles and 
									the Rolling Stones.</p>
								<p>
									2. Guitar-based instrumentation: 
									The electric guitar was the central instrument in early R&B. 
									It was backed by drums, a double bass (later an electric bass guitar), 
									and piano. Melodies were performed by lead vocalists 
									or the occasional saxophone.

								<h2>
									2 Characteristics of Contemporary R&B
								</h2>
								<p>
									Contemporary R&B music shares some traits with the original R&B genre but differs in notable ways.
								</p>
							</div>
							<div class="flip-card-back">
								<p>
									1. Keyboard-based instrumentation: 
									While early R&B was driven by guitars, most contemporary R&B is based 
									around keyboards, synthesizers, and drum machines. Some R&B singers, 
									like Alicia Keys, favor acoustic piano, but many others embrace 
									electronic keyboards and software loops.
								</p>
								<p>
									2. Incorporation of hip hop: 
									In recent years, the line between hip hop and R&B has blurred. 
									Bryson Tiller's debut album Trapsoul and Drake's debut Thank 
									Me Later feature equal parts singing and rapping. 
								</p>
								<!-- <p>
									3. Smooth, melismatic vocals: 
									R&B singers like Luther Vandross, Whitney Houston, and Mariah Carey made vocal 
									virtuosity an integral part of the genre upheld by artists 
									like Jazmine Sullivan, Alicia Keys, and Erykah Badu.
